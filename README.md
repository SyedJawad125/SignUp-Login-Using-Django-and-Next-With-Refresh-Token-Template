## 📌 Introduction

**E-Commerce Platform** is a modular, production-grade full-stack application built to power modern online retail businesses. It combines a **Django REST Framework** backend with a **Next.js / React** frontend, backed by **PostgreSQL** for relational data integrity.

The system is designed around **clean architecture principles** — a clear separation between the API layer, service layer, and data layer — making it easy to extend, test, and scale. It supports the complete e-commerce lifecycle: from user registration and OTP verification, through product discovery and cart management, to checkout, multi-gateway payments, order fulfillment, and post-purchase returns.

This project is intended as both a **reference implementation** for building enterprise-grade commerce platforms and a **launchpad** for teams that need a solid, secure, and extensible foundation rather than starting from scratch.

**Who is this for?**

| Audience | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| 🚀 Startups | A ready-made, secure commerce backend + storefront to launch on |
| 🏢 Enterprises | Modular architecture that fits into existing microservice ecosystems |
| 👨‍💻 Developers | Clean, well-documented codebase to learn production Django/Next.js patterns |
| 🎓 Recruiters / Hiring Managers | A demonstration of full-stack architectural competency |

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The platform follows a **layered, modular architecture**: presentation (Next.js) → API (DRF) → service layer (business logic) → repository/data layer (PostgreSQL). This separation keeps business rules out of views and serializers, improving testability and long-term maintainability.

```mermaid

    subgraph Client["🖥️ Client Layer"]
        A[Next.js / React SPA]
        A1[Tailwind UI Components]
        A2[API Service Hooks]

        L[Push Notification Service]
    end

    B --> C --> F --> D --> E --> G --> H
    E --> I
    E --> J
    E --> K
    E --> L
```

### Architectural Principles

- **Modular Django Apps** — Each domain (users, products, orders, payments) is an isolated Django app with its own models, serializers, and views.
- **Service Layer** — Business logic (e.g., stock deduction, order state transitions) lives in service classes, not in views.
- **Repository Pattern (where applicable)** — Complex queries are abstracted behind repository functions to decouple ORM logic from business logic.
- **Stateless API** — JWT-based authentication keeps the backend horizontally scalable.
- **Clean Boundaries** — The frontend never talks to the database directly; all access is mediated through versioned REST endpoints.

---

## ⚙️ Backend Stack

The backend is built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework**, structured as a collection of modular apps under a single Django project.

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `authentication/` | JWT auth, OTP, email verification, password reset |
| `users/` | Custom user model, profiles, roles, employees |
| `products/` | Catalog, variants, categories, inventory |
| `cart/` | Guest & authenticated cart logic |
| `orders/` | Order lifecycle, checkout, snapshots |
| `payments/` | Gateway integration, transaction logs |
| `shipping/` | Shipping methods & delivery tracking |
| `reviews/` | Ratings & review moderation |
| `coupons/` | Discount code validation & application |
| `notifications/` | Email templates & push tokens |
| `media/` | Image library & upload handling |

Key backend design choices include **class-based API views**, **custom permission classes** for RBAC enforcement, **DRF serializers** with explicit validation, and **PostgreSQL constraints** to enforce data integrity at the database level, not just in application code.

---

## 🎨 Frontend Stack

The frontend is a **Next.js 14** application using the App Router, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and structured around reusable components, hooks, and context providers for state management (auth state, cart state, wishlist state).

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app/` | Route-based pages (App Router) |
| `components/` | Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, modals) |
| `services/` | API client wrappers (Axios/Fetch abstractions) |
| `hooks/` | Custom hooks (`useAuth`, `useCart`, `useWishlist`) |
| `context/` | Global state providers (Auth, Cart, Theme) |
| `styles/` | Tailwind configuration & global styles |

The frontend communicates exclusively through the versioned REST API, with JWT access tokens attached via an Axios interceptor and automatic refresh-token rotation handled in a dedicated auth service.

---

## 🗄️ Database

**PostgreSQL** is used as the primary data store, chosen for its strong consistency guarantees, native JSON support, and mature indexing capabilities.

### Key Practices

- Proper **indexing** on frequently filtered/sorted fields (SKU, category, price, created_at)
- **Foreign Keys**, **OneToOne**, and **ManyToMany** relationships modeled explicitly
- **Computed properties** (e.g., average rating, current stock status) calculated at the model or query level
- **Database-level constraints** (unique constraints, check constraints) to prevent invalid states
- **Validation** at both serializer and model level for defense in depth

### High-Level Entity Relationship Overview

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    USER ||--o{ ADDRESS : owns
    USER ||--o{ REVIEW : writes
    USER ||--o{ CART : owns
    USER ||--o{ WISHLIST : owns
    ROLE ||--o{ USER : assigned_to
    CATEGORY ||--o{ PRODUCT : contains
    PRODUCT ||--o{ PRODUCT_VARIANT : has
    PRODUCT ||--o{ PRODUCT_IMAGE : has
    PRODUCT ||--o{ REVIEW : receives
    PRODUCT_VARIANT ||--o{ INVENTORY : tracked_by
    CART ||--o{ CART_ITEM : contains
    PRODUCT ||--o{ CART_ITEM : referenced_by
    ORDER ||--o{ ORDER_ITEM : contains
    ORDER ||--|| PAYMENT : has
    ORDER ||--|| SHIPPING_METHOD : uses
    ORDER ||--o| COUPON : applies
    ORDER ||--o{ RETURN_REQUEST : may_have
    PRODUCT ||--o{ ORDER_ITEM : referenced_by
```

---

## 🔑 Authentication Flow

Authentication combines **JWT tokens** with an **OTP verification layer** for sensitive actions such as registration and password resets.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend (Next.js)
    participant A as Auth API (DRF)
    participant D as Database
    participant E as Email Service

    U->>F: Submit registration form
    F->>A: POST /api/auth/register
    A->>D: Create inactive user
    A->>E: Send OTP email
    E-->>U: OTP Code
    U->>F: Enter OTP
    F->>A: POST /api/auth/verify-otp
    A->>D: Activate user account
    A-->>F: Success response

    U->>F: Submit login credentials
    F->>A: POST /api/auth/login
    A->>D: Validate credentials
    A-->>F: Access Token + Refresh Token
    F->>F: Store tokens (memory/http-only cookie)

    Note over F,A: Subsequent requests
    F->>A: GET /api/products (Authorization: Bearer <token>)
    A->>A: Validate JWT & permissions
    A-->>F: Protected resource response
```

### Password Reset via OTP

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as Auth API
    participant E as Email Service

    U->>F: Request password reset
    F->>A: POST /api/auth/forgot-password
    A->>E: Send OTP / reset token
    E-->>U: OTP / Reset Link
    U->>F: Submit OTP + new password
    F->>A: POST /api/auth/reset-password
    A-->>F: Password updated confirmation
```

---

## 🛡️ Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Access control is enforced through a combination of **Roles**, **Permissions**, and **Permission Groups**, checked at the DRF permission-class level on every request.

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Roles** | High-level identities: Superuser, Staff, Employee, Customer |
| **Permissions** | Granular action rights (e.g., `can_manage_products`, `can_view_orders`) |
| **Permission Groups** | Reusable bundles of permissions assigned to roles |
| **Module Permissions** | Per-module access control (Products, Orders, Payments, etc.) |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User] --> B[Role]
    B --> C[Permission Group]
    C --> D[Permission 1]
    C --> E[Permission 2]
    C --> F[Module Permission]
    F --> G{Access Granted?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Proceed to View]
    G -->|No| I[403 Forbidden]
```

---

## 👤 User Management

The platform uses a **fully custom User model** rather than Django's default, allowing flexible authentication and rich profile data.

**Core capabilities:**

- Username-based login with email and mobile number support
- Profile image upload
- Email verification & OTP-based account activation
- Password reset via OTP and secure token links
- Login attempt tracking with automatic account blocking on repeated failures
- Distinct handling for active/inactive, staff, superuser, customer, and employee accounts
- Employee invitation workflow with status tracking (invited, active, suspended)
- Push notification device token storage for mobile/web push integration

---

## 📦 Product Management

The product module is the catalog backbone, supporting rich variant modeling and merchandising features.

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Categories | Hierarchical product categorization |
| Products | Core product entity with descriptions, pricing, metadata |
| Product Images | Multiple images per product with ordering |
| Product Variants | Combinations of color, size, material |
| Tags | Freeform tagging for discovery & filtering |
| Sales Products | Time-boxed sale pricing |
| Discount Products | Percentage/fixed discounts |
| Ratings & Reviews | Customer feedback with average rating computation |
| SKU Generation | Automatic, unique SKU assignment per variant |

---

## 📊 Inventory Management

Inventory is tracked at the **variant level**, with automated stock-health signals to prevent overselling and stockouts.

- **Stock Quantity** — real-time available units per variant
- **Low Stock Detection** — automatic flagging below a threshold
- **Reorder Point** — configurable trigger for restocking workflows
- **Minimum / Maximum Stock** — enforced bounds for inventory planning

---

## 🛒 Shopping Cart

Supports both **guest carts** (session-based) and **authenticated carts** (user-linked), with automatic cart merging on login.

- Add / update / remove cart items
- Quantity validation against live stock
- Price recalculation on every mutation
- Persisted server-side for authenticated users

---

## ❤️ Wishlist

Authenticated users can save products for later, independent of cart state, with simple add/remove endpoints and duplicate prevention.

---

## 📦 Orders

Orders move through a well-defined lifecycle and capture **immutable snapshots** of relevant data at the time of purchase (address, shipping method, pricing) so historical orders remain accurate even if the underlying data changes later.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending
    Pending --> Booked: Payment Initiated
    Booked --> Processing: Payment Confirmed
    Processing --> Delivered: Shipment Completed
    Processing --> Cancelled: Cancelled by Admin/Customer
    Pending --> Cancelled: Cancelled before Payment
    Delivered --> [*]
    Cancelled --> [*]
```

**Each order stores:**

- Customer reference
- Delivery address snapshot
- Shipping method & cost
- Applied coupon & discount
- Payment status
- Full line-item order details

---

## 💳 Payments

The payment module abstracts multiple gateways behind a unified interface, with full auditability.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Transaction ID | Unique gateway transaction reference |
| Payment Status | Pending / Success / Failed / Refunded |
| Gateway Response | Raw response stored for audit/debugging |
| Refunds | Linked refund records |
| Audit Logs | Immutable log of payment state changes |

**Supported payment methods:**

`Cash on Delivery` · `JazzCash` · `EasyPaisa` · `PayPal` · `Credit Card` · `Debit Card`

---

flowchart LR
    subgraph Server["Ubuntu Server"]
        N[Nginx] --> G[Gunicorn]
        G --> D[Django App - Docker Container]
        D --> P[(PostgreSQL - Docker Container)]
        N --> F[Next.js - Docker Container]
    end
    U[Users] --> N
```

### Example `docker-compose.yml` outline

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    command: gunicorn ecommerce.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
    env_file: ./backend/.env
    depends_on:
      - db
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    command: npm run start
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: ecommerce_db
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    depends_on:
      - backend
      - frontend

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

### Deployment Steps

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d --build
